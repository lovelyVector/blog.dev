# The start of something wonderful

This is going to be the place where I write down all of my ideas for this web application.

The thing I should be working on now is the look and feel of the application.

I think I want to use the flat looking twitter bootstrap.

I also want to be able to use the bower package manager.

## Bower Packages
What else do I want to do?
Where should js files go?
Where should css files go?


I need to find a better posture for a more efficient workflow.

I feel like I am hunched over alot. It's also really hot in here. And I have a headache.

## Layout
### Header
### Footer
### Content


## Blade
This is the templeting engine that I need to learn.
